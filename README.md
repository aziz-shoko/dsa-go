# dsa-go
just some Go dsa stuff to learn DSA and Go bc i have nothing better to do in sweden

## Go Learning Notes
* Go doesn't have "classes" - it uses structs with methods
* A "package" in Go is simply a directory of Go files
* A "library" is typically a collection of related packages

## Initial plan for Repository Structure
Each subdirectory would be its own package with a descriptive name
```
dsa-go/
├── sorting/
│   ├── quicksort/
│   ├── mergesort/
│   └── bucketsort/
├── trees/
│   ├── binarytree/
│   └── bst/
├── lists/
│   ├── linkedlist/
│   └── doublylinkedlist/
└── graphs/
    ├── directed/
    └── undirected/
```
