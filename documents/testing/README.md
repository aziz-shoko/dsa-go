# Testing

This folder is just for learning Go through testing: [link](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/hello-world)

## Discipline

- Write a test
- Make the compiler pass
- Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
- Write enough code to make the test pass
- Refactor

## The TDD process and why the steps are important

1. Write a failing test and see it fail so we know we have written a relevant test for our
   requirements and seen that it produces an easy to understand description of the failure

2. Writing the smallest amount of code to make it pass so we know we have working software

3. Then refactor, backed with the safety of our tests to ensure we have well-crafted code
   that is easy to work with
